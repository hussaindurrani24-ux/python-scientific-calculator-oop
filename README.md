# python-scientific-calculator-oop
â€œA simple scientific calculator in Python using OOP and file handling to save calculation history."
This is a simple **scientific calculator** written in Python using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It supports basic arithmetic, advanced math, trigonometric, and logarithmic/exponential operations.  
It also **stores your calculation history** in a text file.

# Features
- **Basic operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- **Advanced operations**: Power and Square Root  
- **Trigonometric functions** (in degrees): Sine, Cosine, Tangent  
- **Logarithmic and Exponential**: Natural log, Log base 10, Exponential  
- **History saving**: All operations are recorded in `history.txt` automatically  

# How to Use
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.  
2. Save the code as `oop stfc calculator.py`.  
3. Run the program in terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   oop stfc calculator.py
4.Choose the operation from the menu:
1.for Basic (+, -, *, /)
2.for Advanced (power, sqrt)
3.for Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan)
4.for Log/Exp (ln, log10, exp)
5.to view History
0.to Exit

Example:
1) Basic  2) Adv  3) Trig  4) Log/Exp  5) History  0) Exit
Choice: 1
a: 5
b: 3
+ - * /: +
= 8.0
